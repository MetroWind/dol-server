= DoL Server

== How does it work?

This is an HTTP server that serves a web page that wraps an Degree of
Lewdity page in a frame. It provides server-side saves. The wrapper
web page has two addition buttons to load saves from the server, and
push the saves to the server. When it saves to the server, it
basically takes a snapshot of the current local storage of the game
(indexedDB, localStorage, and sessionStorage) and stores that in the
server; similarly when it loads saves from the server, the local
storage of the game is overwritten. This does not alter DoL in anyway,
so if you save the game normally, it is still local. The server does
not know about it.

The server actually keeps all saves it receives. It never removes old
saves (for now).

== Deployment

1. Build DoL by following the
https://gitgud.io/Vrelnir/degrees-of-lewdity#how-to-build[official
instructions]. This should produce `Degrees of Lewdity.html`.
2. Download the server binary from “Releases”, uncompress and copy it
to somewhere that is in your `$PATH`.
3. Write a config file for the server. See
https://github.com/MetroWind/service-management/blob/master/dol-server/config.yaml[example].
The setting `dol-dir` should point to the directory that contains
`Degrees of Lewdity.html`. The server will create a SQLite database in
the directory pointed by `data-dir`, and the directory should be
created before running the server. The server expects the config file
to be at `/etc/dol-server.yaml`, which can be changed with `-c`.
4. Run the server.
